The API load tests are carried out by ![Locust](https://locust.io/), a Python-based open source load testing tool.
`student.py` and `teacher.py` target at student APIs and teacher APIs respectively.
`users70nonstop.html`, `users100normal.html` and `users5000real.html` are three HTML-format reports,
all generated by `student.py` but in different factors.
The first one swarms 70 virtual users that make requests one by one without waiting, which simulates the 
extreme scene. While the second one simulates 100 users making requests at a more normal rate (i.e. `wait_time = between
(0.5, 1)`). And the last one swarms 5000 virtual users making requests at the real client rate (single request every 
one or two minutes), which should represent the real performance behavior (and it seems well).
By the way, the test environment is a common home-use laptop, with an i3-8100 CPU and 8 GB memory.
